# TractSeg training and test
The Apps [TractSeg training](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.204) and [TractSeg test](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.205) are derived from the original App [TractSeg](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.186), with the difference that you can perform your own training on your own data. TractSeg is a tool for fast and accurate white matter bundle segmentation from Diffusion MRI, developed by (Wasserthal et al., 2018), under Apache-2.0 License. Please refer to this App https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.186 and this repository https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg for a comprehensive documentation of the method.

### TractSeg training App
The App for training TractSeg on your own data is https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.204.

Inputs: \
CSD peaks and ground truth segmentation bundle masks that you want to use to train the network, of multiple subjects. CSD peaks can be obtained from dwi data using this App: https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.172.

Outputs: \
Pretrained weights computed by training the network, that you can use as input for the TractSeg test App. 

### TractSeg test App
The App for testing TractSeg after your own training is https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.205.

Inputs: \
CSD Peaks of the (single) subject you want to obtain the bundle segmentation and the pretrained weights computed by training the network with the TractSeg training App.

Outputs: \
Bundle segmentation as list of bundle masks in nifti format.
